# ALS_classification

## Introduction

This repository is dedicated to tackling a multi-class classification problem within the realm of medical image analysis, focusing on distinguishing between three classes: control (healthy), ALS concordant, and ALS discordant. Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease, and early and accurate diagnosis is crucial for patient care.

Given the challenges posed by the limited size of medical datasets, this project employs advanced machine learning techniques, including transfer learning and attention mechanisms, to enhance model performance and reliability.

## Project Status

ðŸš§ This project is currently under active development. Regular updates will be made to improve the model and incorporate more features.

## Key Features

- **Transfer Learning**: Leverages pre-trained models to overcome the limitation of small datasets, ensuring a more robust feature extraction process.
- **Attention Mechanisms**: Implements attention mechanisms to improve model interpretability and focus on relevant features within the images, enhancing the diagnosis process.
